# Comparison-of-Region-Based-on-Sales

The director of a leading organization is aiming to compare sales between two regions using a dashboard. The data will be gathered from the Sample Superstore dataset. The data will be organized into a folder for customer names and order IDs. A hierarchy called Location will be created for the variable Country. Two parameters, Primary Region and Secondary Region, will be created, listing all regions. A calculated field will be created for both regions, and a first-order date will be set. The dashboard will be arranged to display the details of the Primary Region and Secondary Region, including the first order date, total sales, average sales per order, number of customers, orders, and products in sale.
